Functions

definition: a piece of source code, separate from the larger program,
that performs a specific task

Reasons to use functions:

1. Reduce complex tasks into simpler tasks
2. Eliminate duplicate code
3. Code reuse
4. Distribute tasks to multiple programmers
5. Hide implementation details - abstraction
6. Improves debugging by improving traceability
